# Video-Editing-By-Script

Edits video into separate video segments from a tagged text script. 
Insert these tags into your transcript file in this exact format, on their own line. Program ignors all other lines of text.
Requires ffmpeg.exe to be installed in path or in the same directory as this program (www.ffmpeg.org)

00:15:10:START_SEG: Title Of Segment   
00:19:33:STOP_SEG                   

The first tag tells the program where to start the video segment and gives it the name "Title_Of_Segment.mp4", replacing spaces with '_'.
The second tag tells the program where to stop the video segment.
